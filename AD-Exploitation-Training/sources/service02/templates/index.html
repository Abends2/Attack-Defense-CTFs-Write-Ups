<title>My super secure service!</title>
<p>This is premium open source software! The source code is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/ldruschk/ad_exploitation_training/tree/master/service02">https://github.com/ldruschk/ad_exploitation_training/tree/master/service02</a></p>
<h1>TODO</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Add login and registration forms to increase the usability (but if you are leet you can figure out how this works simply by looking at the source code :)</li>
    <li>Make the service do something except leaking flags</li>
    <li>Don't delete accounts after 10 seconds (turns out humans don't like this)</li>
</ul>
